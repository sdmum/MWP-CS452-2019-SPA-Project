Sunday,

It seems like a tremendous amount of time must go into figuring out small issues that arise. Progress seems slow, but it feels good to finally get something to work.
I was finally able to get the animation to play on the text area. So far it looks like things are running cleanly, and I am satisfied with my progress. I hope that the next portions 
of the project go smoothly. I can't believe how much I've learned so far. I am finally able to have conversations with my programming buddies now that we're applying real life concepts
in the industry. As difficult as fetch is to understand, it's amazing to see that this is one of the ways the internet shares data. 

My next goal from here is to get the 'Refresh Animation' button to work. 

From there, I will complete the logout button/ logout function.

After that I will complete the History API.
